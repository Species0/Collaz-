## What the hell is collatz conjucture you may ask??

Choose any positive whole number 
and apply these two rules 

If number is even divide by two

If the number is odd multiply by two and add 1

Note:do this until they fall down to 4,2,1

## Observation ðŸ”¬
They all fall down to 4,2,1 from there on it is a loop
